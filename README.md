# Spinal_Orientation
The purpose of this repo is to create a CNN that determines the orientation of a 2D spinal fluoroscopic image. There are generally 3 orientations of a fluoroscopic spinal image: Anterior-Posterior, Oblique, and Lateral. Another purpose of this repo is to also help familiarize myself (a noob) with Computer Vision workflows.
